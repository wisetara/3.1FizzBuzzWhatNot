Epicodus Week 3 Day 1 - Fizzbuzz, title case, allergies

Fizzbuzz
To start off our first week of Ruby, write a method in Ruby that takes a number and returns an array of numbers and strings that correspond to the Fizzbuzz solution (i.e., fizzbuzz(7) returns [1, 2, 'fizz', 4, 'buzz', 'fizz', 7]). Use RSpec and the BDD process, of course.

Title case
To keep easing into things, let's revisit the Title Case problem from the other week. As a reminder, make sure your code can handle inputs in all lowercase, all uppercase, a mix of different cases, one word, multiple words, and anything else you can think of.

Allergies
Here's something a bit trickier. An allergy score is a single number that tells what someone is allergic to. The scores for each allergen are:

allergen     score
eggs         1
peanuts      2
shellfish    4
strawberries 8
tomatoes     16
chocolate    32
pollen       64
cats         128
So if someone is allergic to eggs and strawberries, they get a score of 9.

Write a method that takes someones score as an argument, and returns an array listing what they're allergic to.

Poker hand
Write a method takes an array of cards, represented by letters and number, as an argument, and returns the poker hand the cards represent. For example, poker_hand(['2S', '3C', '4D', '5C', '6H']) would return 'straight'.
